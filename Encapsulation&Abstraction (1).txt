                                                   Encapsulation :
                                                   
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).

It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 

This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.

To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. 

Those types of variables are known as private variables.
                                                
                                                   Abstraction :

Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. 
This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. 

That enables the user to implement even more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden background/back-end complexity.

That’s a very generic core topic not only limited to object-oriented programming. You can observe it everywhere in the real world or in our surroundings.

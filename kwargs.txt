                                            python * args and ** kwargs:
Python *args:

As in the above example we are not sure about the number of arguments that can be passed to a function. Python has *args which allow us to pass the variable number of non keyword arguments to function.

In the function, we should use an asterisk * before the parameter name to pass variable length arguments.The arguments are passed as a tuple and these passed arguments make tuple inside the function with same name as the parameter excluding asterisk *.

Python **kwargs :

Python passes variable length non keyword argument to function using *args but we cannot use this to pass keyword argument. For this problem Python has got a solution called **kwargs, it allows us to pass the variable length of keyword arguments to the function.

In the function, we use the double asterisk ** before the parameter name to denote this type of argument. The arguments are passed as a dictionary and these arguments make a dictionary inside function with name same as the parameter excluding double asterisk **.
